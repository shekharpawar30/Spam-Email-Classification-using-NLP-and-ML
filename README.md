<h1>Spam Email Classification Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In today's digital age, email has become a popular mode of communication. However, with the increase in email usage, spam emails have also become a major problem. Spam emails are unwanted emails that are sent to a large number of recipients, often for commercial or malicious purposes.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>This project uses a machine learning approach to classify emails as spam or not spam. The following steps were taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: A dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) was collected.</li>
<li>Data Preprocessing: The collected data was preprocessed by removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization.</li>
<li>Feature Extraction: Features were extracted from the preprocessed data using techniques such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF.</li>
<li>Model Training: A machine learning model was trained on the extracted features to classify emails as spam or not spam.</li>
<li>Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on a test dataset to measure its accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Explanation</h2>
<p>The code for this project is written in Python and uses the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.</li>
<li>Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks such as feature extraction, model training, and model evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code consists of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data loading and preprocessing</li>
<li>Feature extraction</li>
<li>Model training</li>
<li>Model evaluation</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Execute the Code</h2>
<p>To execute the code, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal: pip install nltk scikit-learn</li>
<li>Download the dataset used for this project from repository.</li>
<li>Place the dataset in the same directory as the Python code.</li>
<li>Run the Python code </li>
<li>The code will train the model and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.</li>
<li>The accuracy of the model will be printed to the console.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The trained model was evaluated on a test dataset and achieved an accuracy of 97.5.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates the use of NLP and machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam. The results show that the trained model can accurately classify emails with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
